<br>

 It is python based and can be implemented in bots, websites and mobile. You can apply it easily using :

- Django
- Flask
- python-telegram-bot

<br>

<p>In the future we will provide an open source api that you can use to easily identify plant species using image objects</p>

Collect pictures of your plants and I will give you a machine learning model to identify plants.

let's contribute to my project !!!
